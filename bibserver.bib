ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We show that if $H$ is a group of polynomial growth whose growth rate is at
least quadratic then the $L_p$ compression of the wreath product $\Z\bwr H$
equals $\max{\frac{1}{p},{1/2}}$. We also show that the $L_p$ compression of
$\Z\bwr \Z$ equals $\max{\frac{p}{2p-1},\frac23}$ and the $L_p$ compression of
$(\Z\bwr\Z)_0$ (the zero section of $\Z\bwr \Z$, equipped with the metric
induced from $\Z\bwr \Z$) equals $\max{\frac{p+1}{2p},\frac34}$. The fact that
the Hilbert compression exponent of $\Z\bwr\Z$ equals $\frac23$ while the
Hilbert compression exponent of $(\Z\bwr\Z)_0$ equals $\frac34$ is used to show
that there exists a Lipschitz function $f:(\Z\bwr\Z)_0\to L_2$ which cannot be
extended to a Lipschitz function defined on all of $\Z\bwr \Z$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let ${\cal T}$ be a rooted Galton-Watson tree with offspring distribution
$\{p_k\}$ that has $p_0=0$, mean $m=\sum kp_k>1$ and exponential tails.
Consider the $\lambda$-biased random walk $\{X_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ on ${\cal T}$;
this is the nearest neighbor random walk which, when at a vertex $v$ with $d_v$
offspring, moves closer to the root with probability $\lambda/(\lambda+d_v)$,
and moves to each of the offspring with probability $1/(\lambda+d_v)$. It is
known that this walk has an a.s. constant speed $\v=\lim_n |X_n|/n$
  (where $|X_n|$ is the distance of $X_n$ from the root), with $\v>0$ for $
0<\lambda<m$ and $\v=0$ for $\lambda \ge m$. For all $\lambda \le m$, we prove
a quenched CLT for $|X_n|-n\v$. (For $\lambda>m$ the walk is positive
recurrent, and there is no CLT.) The most interesting case by far is
$\lambda=m$, where the CLT has the following form: for almost every ${\cal T}$,
the ratio $|X_{[nt]}|/\sqrt{n}$ converges in law as $n \to \infty$ to a
deterministic multiple of the absolute value of a Brownian motion. Our approach
to this case is based on an explicit description of an invariant measure for
the walk from the point of view of the particle (previously, such a measure was
explicitly known only for $\lambda=1$) and the construction of appropriate
harmonic coordinates.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Suppose that a coin with bias theta is tossed at renewal times of a renewal
process, and a fair coin is tossed at all other times. Let mu_\theta be the
distribution of the observed sequence of coin tosses, and let u_n denote the
chance of a renewal at time n. Harris and Keane showed that if sum_{n=1}^infty
u_n^2=\infty, then mu_theta and \mu_0 are singular, while if sum_{n=1}^{infty}
u_n^2<infty and theta is small enough, then mu_theta is absolutely continuous
with respect to mu_0. They conjectured that absolute continuity should not
depend on theta, but only on the square-summability of {u_n}. We show that in
fact the power law governing the decay of {u_n} is crucial, and for some
renewal sequences {u_n}, there is a {phase transition at a critical parameter
theta_c in (0,1): for |theta|<theta_c the measures mu_theta$ and mu_0 are
mutually absolutely continuous, but for |theta|>theta_c, they are singular. We
also prove that when u_n=O(n^{-1}), the measures mu_theta for theta in [-1,1]
are all mutually absolutely continuous.

sample from the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of the Ising model. Cooper, Dyer,
Frieze and Rue proved that on the complete graph K_n the mixing time of the
chain is at most O(n^{1/2}) for all non-critical temperatures. In this paper we
show that the mixing time is Theta(1) in high temperatures, Theta(log n) in low
temperatures and Theta(n^{1/4}) at criticality. We also provide an upper bound
of O(log n) for Swendsen-Wang dynamics for the q-state ferromagnetic Potts

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let $\Xi$ be a discrete set in ${\mathbb{R}}^d$. Call the elements of $\Xi$
centers. The well-known Voronoi tessellation partitions ${\mathbb{R}}^d$ into
polyhedral regions (of varying sizes) by allocating each site of
${\mathbb{R}}^d$ to the closest center. Here we study ``fair'' allocations of
${\mathbb{R}}^d$ to $\Xi$ in which the regions allocated to different centers
have equal volumes. We prove that if $\Xi$ is obtained from a
translation-invariant point process, then there is a unique fair allocation
which is stable in the sense of the Gale--Shapley marriage problem. (I.e.,
sites and centers both prefer to be allocated as close as possible, and an
allocation is said to be unstable if some site and center both prefer each
other over their current allocations.) We show that the region allocated to
each center $\xi$ is a union of finitely many bounded connected sets. However,
in the case of a Poisson process, an infinite volume of sites are allocated to
centers further away than $\xi$. We prove power law lower bounds on the
allocation distance of a typical site. It is an open problem to prove any upper
bound in $d>1$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We consider linear iterated function systems with a random multiplicative
error on the real line. Our system is $\{x\mapsto d_i + \lambda_i Y
x\}_{i=1}^m$, where $d_i\in \R$ and $\lambda_i>0$ are fixed and $Y> 0$ is a
random variable with an absolutely continuous distribution. The iterated maps
are applied randomly according to a stationary ergodic process, with the
sequence of i.i.d. errors $y_1,y_2,...$, distributed as $Y$, independent of
everything else. Let $h$ be the entropy of the process, and let $\chi =
E[\log(\lambda Y)]$ be the Lyapunov exponent. Assuming that $\chi < 0$, we
obtain a family of conditional measures $\nu_y$ on the line, parametrized by $y
= (y_1,y_2,...)$, the sequence of errors. Our main result is that if $h >
|\chi|$, then $\nu_y$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue
measure for a.e. $y$. We also prove that if $h < |\chi|$, then the measure
$\nu_y$ is singular and has dimension $h/|\chi|$ for a.e. $y$. These results
are applied to a randomly perturbed IFS suggested by Y. Sinai, and to a class
of random sets considered by R. Arratia, motivated by probabilistic number
theory.

ARXIV:SUMMARY={Recall the classical hypothesis testing setting with two convex sets of
probability distributions P and Q. One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a
distribution p in P or from a distribution q in Q and wants to decide from
which set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential
rate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood
ratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q.
  We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p in
P and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on
the previous samples. In other words, in the k'th round, an adversary, having
observed all the previous samples in rounds 1,...,k-1, chooses p_k in P and q_k
in Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in
this case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple
maximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q.
  We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis
testing for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example, it can
be used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of
all separable states using only measurements that can be implemented with local
operations and classical communication (LOCC). The basic idea is that in our
setup, the deleterious effects of entanglement can be simulated by an adaptive
classical adversary.
  We prove a quantum Stein's Lemma in this setting: In many circumstances, the
optimal hypothesis testing rate is equal to an appropriate notion of quantum
relative entropy between two states. In particular, our arguments yield an
alternate proof of Li and Winter's recent strengthening of strong subadditivity
for quantum relative entropy.},

complete directed graph on $n$ vertices whose edge weights are chosen
independently and uniformly at random from $[0,1]$ is $O(n^2)$, in expectation
and with high probability. This resolves a long standing open problem. The
algorithm is a variant of the dynamic all-pairs shortest paths algorithm of
Demetrescu and Italiano. The analysis relies on a proof that the number of
\emph{locally shortest paths} in such randomly weighted graphs is $O(n^2)$, in
expectation and with high probability. We also present a dynamic version of the
algorithm that recomputes all shortest paths after a random edge update in
$O(\log^{2}n)$ expected time.

Suppose that $\phi$ is a measure preserving homomorphism from $B(p)$ to $B(q)$.
We prove that if the coding length of $\phi$ has a finite 1/2 moment, then
$\sigma_p^2=\sigma_q^2$, where $\sigma_p^2=\sum_i p_i(-\log p_i-h)^2$ is the
{\dof informational variance} of $p$. In this result, which sharpens a theorem
of Parry (1979), the 1/2 moment cannot be replaced by a lower moment. On the
other hand, for any $\theta<1$, we exhibit probability vectors $p$ and $q$ that
are not permutations of each other, such that there exists a finitary
isomorphism $\Phi$ from $B(p)$ to $B(q)$ where the coding lengths of $\Phi$ and
of its inverse have a finite $\theta$ moment. We also present an extension to

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We provide a complete description of the giant component of the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ as soon as it emerges from the scaling
window, i.e., for $p = (1+\epsilon)/n$ where $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$ and
$\epsilon=o(1)$.
  Our description is particularly simple for $\epsilon = o(n^{-1/4})$, where
the giant component $C_1$ is contiguous with the following model (i.e., every
graph property that holds with high probability for this model also holds
w.h.p. for $C_1$). Let $Z$ be normal with mean $\frac23 \epsilon^3 n$ and
variance $\epsilon^3 n$, and let $K$ be a random 3-regular graph on $2\lfloor
Z\rfloor$ vertices. Replace each edge of $K$ by a path, where the path lengths
are i.i.d. geometric with mean $1/\epsilon$. Finally, attach an independent
Poisson($1-\epsilon$)-Galton-Watson tree to each vertex.
  A similar picture is obtained for larger $\epsilon=o(1)$, in which case the
random 3-regular graph is replaced by a random graph with $N_k$ vertices of
degree $k$ for $k\geq 3$, where $N_k$ has mean and variance of order
$\epsilon^k n$.
  This description enables us to determine fundamental characteristics of the
supercritical random graph. Namely, we can infer the asymptotics of the
diameter of the giant component for any rate of decay of $\epsilon$, as well as
the mixing time of the random walk on $C_1$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  In a recent work of the authors and Kim, we derived a complete description of
the largest component of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ as it
emerges from the critical window, i.e. for $p = (1+\epsilon)/n$ where
$\epsilon^3 n \to\infty$ and $\epsilon=o(1)$, in terms of a tractable
contiguous model. Here we provide the analogous description for the
supercritical giant component, i.e., the largest component of $G(n,p)$ for $p =
\lambda/n$ where $\lambda>1$ is fixed. The contiguous model is roughly as
follows: Take a random degree sequence and sample a random multigraph with
these degrees to arrive at the kernel; Replace the edges by paths whose lengths
are i.i.d. geometric variables to arrive at the 2-core; Attach i.i.d. Poisson
Galton-Watson trees to the vertices for the final giant component. As in the
case of the emerging giant, we obtain this result via a sequence of contiguity
arguments at the heart of which are Kim's Poisson-cloning method and the
Pittel-Wormald local limit theorems.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Benjamini, Lyons and Schramm [Random Walks and Discrete Potential Theory
(1999) 56-84] considered properties of an infinite graph G, and the simple
random walk on it, that are preserved by random perturbations. In this paper we
solve several problems raised by those authors. The anchored expansion constant
is a variant of the Cheeger constant; its positivity implies positive lower
speed for the simple random walk, as shown by Virag [Geom. Funct. Anal. 10
(2000) 1588-1605]. We prove that if G has a positive anchored expansion
constant, then so does every infinite cluster of independent percolation with
parameter p sufficiently close to 1; a better estimate for the parameters p
where this holds is in the Appendix. We also show that positivity of the
anchored expansion constant is preserved under a random stretch if and only if
the stretching law has an exponential tail. We then study a simple random walk
in the infinite percolation cluster in Cayley graphs of certain amenable groups
known as ``lamplighter groups.'' We prove that zero speed for a random walk on
a lamplighter group implies zero speed for random walk on an infinite cluster,
for any supercritical percolation parameter p. For p large enough, we also
establish the converse.

ARXIV:SUMMARY={We study the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem in a setting where the
player incurs a unit cost each time he switches actions. We prove that the
player's $T$-round minimax regret in this setting is
$\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$, thereby closing a fundamental gap in our
understanding of learning with bandit feedback. In the corresponding
full-information version of the problem, the minimax regret is known to grow at
a much slower rate of $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$. The difference between these two
rates provides the \emph{first} indication that learning with bandit feedback
can be significantly harder than learning with full-information feedback
(previous results only showed a different dependence on the number of actions,
but not on $T$.)
  In addition to characterizing the inherent difficulty of the multi-armed
bandit problem with switching costs, our results also resolve several other
open problems in online learning. One direct implication is that learning with
bandit feedback against bounded-memory adaptive adversaries has a minimax
regret of $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$. Another implication is that the
minimax regret of online learning in adversarial Markov decision processes
(MDPs) is $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$. The key to all of our results is a new
randomized construction of a multi-scale random walk, which is of independent
interest and likely to prove useful in additional settings.},

compact in the path metric, and F is a Lipschitz function on \partial{U}, then
for each \beta\in\R there exists a unique viscosity solution to the
\beta-biased infinity Laplacian equation \beta |\nabla u| + \Delta_\infty u=0
on U that extends F, where \Delta_\infty u= |\nabla u|^{-2} \sum_{i,j}
u_{x_i}u_{x_ix_j} u_{x_j}.
  In the proof, we extend the tug-of-war ideas of Peres, Schramm, Sheffield and
Wilson, and define the \beta-biased \eps-game as follows. The starting position
is x_0 \in U. At the k^\text{th} step the two players toss a suitably biased
coin (in our key example, player I wins with odds of \exp(\beta\eps) to 1), and
the winner chooses x_k with d(x_k,x_{k-1}) < \eps. The game ends when x_k \in
\partial{U}, and player II pays the amount F(x_k) to player I. We prove that
the value u^{\eps}(x_0) of this game exists, and that \|u^\eps - u\|_\infty \to
0 as \eps \to 0, where u is the unique extension of F to \overline{U} that
satisfies comparison with \beta-exponential cones. Comparison with exponential
cones is a notion that we introduce here, and generalizing a theorem of
Crandall, Evans and Gariepy regarding comparison with linear cones, we show
that a continuous function satisfies comparison with \beta-exponential cones if
and only if it is a viscosity solution to the \beta-biased infinity Laplacian
equation.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Bootstrap percolation on an arbitrary graph has a random initial
configuration, where each vertex is occupied with probability p, independently
of each other, and a deterministic spreading rule with a fixed parameter k: if
a vacant site has at least k occupied neighbors at a certain time step, then it
becomes occupied in the next step. This process is well-studied on Z^d; here we
investigate it on regular and general infinite trees and on non-amenable Cayley
graphs. The critical probability is the infimum of those values of p for which
the process achieves complete occupation with positive probability. On general
trees, we find the following discontinuity: if the branching number of a tree
is strictly smaller than k, then the critical probability is 1, while it is
1-1/k on the k-ary tree. A related result is that in any rooted tree T, there
is a way of erasing k children of the root, together with all their
descendants, and repeating this for all remaining children, and so on, such
that the remaining tree T' has branching number \br(T') \leq \max (\br(T)-k,
0). We also prove that on any 2k-regular non-amenable graph, the critical
probability for the k-rule is strictly positive.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  There is a close connection between intersections of Brownian motion paths
and percolation on trees. Recently, ideas from probability on trees were an
important component of the multifractal analysis of Brownian occupation
measure, in joint work with A. Dembo, J. Rosen and O. Zeitouni. As a
consequence, we proved two conjectures about simple random walk in two
dimensions: The first, due to Erd\H{o}s and Taylor (1960), involves the number
of visits to the most visited lattice site in the first $n$ steps of the walk.
The second, due to Aldous (1989), concerns the number of steps it takes a
simple random walk to cover all points of the $n$ by $n$ lattice torus. The
goal of the lecture is to relate how methods from probability on trees can be
applied to random walks and Brownian motion in Euclidean space.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  By the Cameron--Martin theorem, if a function $f$ is in the Dirichlet space
$D$, then $B+f$ has the same a.s. properties as standard Brownian motion, $B$.
In this paper we examine properties of $B+f$ when $f \notin D$. We start by
establishing a general 0-1 law, which in particular implies that for any fixed
$f$, the Hausdorff dimension of the image and the graph of $B+f$ are constants
a.s. (This 0-1 law applies to any L\'evy process.) Then we show that if the
function $f$ is H\"older$(1/2)$, then $B+f$ is intersection equivalent to $B$.
Moreover, $B+f$ has double points a.s. in dimensions $d\le 3$, while in $d\ge
4$ it does not. We also give examples of functions which are H\"older with
exponent less than $1/2$, that yield double points in dimensions greater than
4. Finally, we show that for $d \ge 2$, the Hausdorff dimension of the image of
$B+f$ is a.s. at least the maximum of 2 and the dimension of the image of $f$.

monotone spin system, and show that interjecting extra updates cannot increase
the expected Hamming distance or the total variation distance to the stationary
distribution. We deduce that for monotone Markov random fields, when block
dynamics contracts a Hamming metric, single-site dynamics mixes in O(n log n)
steps on an n-vertex graph. In particular, our result completes work of Kenyon,
Mossel and Peres concerning Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on trees. Our
approach also shows that on bipartite graphs, alternating updates
systematically between odd and even vertices cannot improve the mixing time by
more than a factor of log n compared to updates at uniform random locations on
an n-vertex graph. Our result is especially effective in comparing block and
single-site dynamics; it has already been used in works of Martinelli,
Sinclair, Mossel, Sly, Ding, Lubetzky, and Peres in various combinations.},

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We study Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on the complete graph on $n$
vertices, known as the Curie-Weiss Model. It is well known that at high
temperature ($\beta < 1$) the mixing time is $\Theta(n\log n)$, whereas at low
temperature ($\beta > 1$) it is $\exp(\Theta(n))$. Recently, Levin, Luczak and
Peres considered a censored version of this dynamics, which is restricted to
non-negative magnetization. They proved that for fixed $\beta > 1$, the
mixing-time of this model is $\Theta(n\log n)$, analogous to the
high-temperature regime of the original dynamics. Furthermore, they showed
\emph{cutoff} for the original dynamics for fixed $\beta<1$. The question
whether the censored dynamics also exhibits cutoff remained unsettled.
  In a companion paper, we extended the results of Levin et al. into a complete
characterization of the mixing-time for the Currie-Weiss model. Namely, we
found a scaling window of order $1/\sqrt{n}$ around the critical temperature
$\beta_c=1$, beyond which there is cutoff at high temperature. However,
determining the behavior of the censored dynamics outside this critical window
seemed significantly more challenging.
  In this work we answer the above question in the affirmative, and establish
the cutoff point and its window for the censored dynamics beyond the critical
window, thus completing its analogy to the original dynamics at high
temperature. Namely, if $\beta = 1 + \delta$ for some $\delta > 0$ with
$\delta^2 n \to \infty$, then the mixing-time has order $(n /
\delta)\log(\delta^2 n)$. The cutoff constant is $(1/2+[2(\zeta^2 \beta /
\delta - 1)]^{-1})$, where $\zeta$ is the unique positive root of
$g(x)=\tanh(\beta x)-x$, and the cutoff window has order $n / \delta$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY={We consider two competing first passage percolation processes started from
uniformly chosen subsets of a random regular graph on N vertices. The processes
are allowed to spread with different rates, start from vertex subsets of
different sizes or at different times. We obtain tight results regarding the
sizes of the vertex sets occupied by each process, showing that in the generic
situation one process will occupy Theta(1) N^alpha vertices, for some 0 < alpha
< 1. The value of alpha is calculated in terms of the relative rates of the
processes, as well as the sizes of the initial vertex sets and the possible
time advantage of one process.
  The motivation for this work comes from the study of viral marketing on
social networks. The described processes can be viewed as two competing
products spreading through a social network (random regular graph). Considering
the processes which grow at different rates (corresponding to different
attraction levels of the two products) or starting at different times (the
first to market advantage) allows to model aspects of real competition. The
results obtained can be interpreted as one of the two products taking the lion
share of the market. We compare these results to the same process run on d
dimensional grids where we show that in the generic situation the two products
will have a linear fraction of the market each.},

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Bargaining games on exchange networks have been studied by both economists
and sociologists. A Balanced Outcome for such a game is an equilibrium concept
that combines notions of stability and fairness. In a recent paper, Kleinberg
and Tardos introduced balanced outcomes to the computer science community and
provided a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the set of such outcomes. Their
work left open a pertinent question: are there natural, local dynamics that
converge quickly to a balanced outcome? In this paper, we provide a partial
answer to this question by showing that simple edge-balancing dynamics converge
to a balanced outcome whenever one exists.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Denote by $\mu_a$ the distribution of the random sum $(1-a) \sum_{j=0}^\infty
\omega_j a^j$, where $P(\omega_j=0)=P(\omega_j=1)=1/2$ and all the choices are
independent. For $0<a<1/2$, the measure $\mu_a$ is supported on $C_a$, the
central Cantor set obtained by starting with the closed united interval,
removing an open central interval of length $(1-2a)$, and iterating this
process inductively on each of the remaining intervals.
  We investigate the convolutions $\mu_a * (\mu_b \circ S_\lambda^{-1})$, where
$S_\lambda(x)=\lambda x$ is a rescaling map. We prove that if the ratio $\log
b/\log a$ is irrational and $\lambda\neq 0$, then \[ D(\mu_a *(\mu_b\circ
S_\lambda^{-1})) = \min(\dim_H(C_a)+\dim_H(C_b),1), \] where $D$ denotes any of
correlation, Hausdorff or packing dimension of a measure.
  We also show that, perhaps surprisingly, for uncountably many values of
$\lambda$ the convolution $\mu_{1/4} *(\mu_{1/3}\circ S_\lambda^{-1})$ is a
singular measure, although $\dim_H(C_{1/4})+\dim_H(C_{1/3})>1$ and $\log (1/3)
/\log (1/4)$ is irrational.

x for Brownian motion on the two dimensional torus. We prove that sup_{x}
T(x,r)/|log r|^2 --> 2/pi as r --> 0. The same applies to Brownian motion on
any smooth, compact connected, two-dimensional, Riemannian manifold with unit
area and no boundary. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture, due to Aldous
(1989), that the number of steps it takes a simple random walk to cover all
points of the lattice torus Z_n^2 is asymptotic to (2n log n)^2/pi. Determining
these asymptotics is an essential step toward analyzing the fractal structure
of the set of uncovered sites before coverage is complete; so far, this
structure was only studied non-rigorously in the physics literature. We also
establish a conjecture, due to Kesten and Revesz, that describes the
asymptotics for the number of steps needed by simple random walk in Z^2 to
cover the disc of radius n.

  majorizing measures theory},
ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We exhibit a strong connection between cover times of graphs, Gaussian
processes, and Talagrand's theory of majorizing measures. In particular, we
show that the cover time of any graph $G$ is equivalent, up to universal
constants, to the square of the expected maximum of the Gaussian free field on
$G$, scaled by the number of edges in $G$. This allows us to resolve a number
of open questions. We give a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that
computes the cover time to within an O(1) factor for any graph, answering a
question of Aldous and Fill (1994). We also positively resolve the blanket time
conjectures of Winkler and Zuckerman (1996), showing that for any graph, the
blanket and cover times are within an O(1) factor. The best previous
approximation factor for both these problems was $O((\log \log n)^2)$ for
$n$-vertex graphs, due to Kahn, Kim, Lovasz, and Vu (2000).

infinite cluster exists in critical percolation on any transitive graph for
which the critical probability is less than 1. Earlier work has established
this for the amenable cases Z^2 and Z^d for large d, as well as for all
non-amenable graphs with unimodular automorphism groups. We show that the
conjecture holds for the basic classes of non-amenable graphs with
non-unimodular automorphism groups: for decorated trees and the non-unimodular
Diestel-Leader graphs. We also show that the connection probability between two
vertices decay exponentially in their distance. Finally, we prove that critical
percolation on the positive part of the lamplighter group has no infinite
clusters.

  In particular, we show that there is a scaling window of width n^{-1/3}

we describe their limiting joint distribution. We also show that for the
subcritical regime, i.e. p = (1-eps(n))p_c where eps(n)=o(1) but \eps(n)n^{1/3}
tends to infinity, the sizes of the largest components are concentrated around
an explicit function of n and eps(n) which is of order o(n^{2/3}). In the
supercritical regime, i.e. p = (1+\eps(n))p_c where eps(n)=o(1) but
eps(n)n^{1/3} tends to infinity, the size of the largest component is
concentrated around the value (2d/(d-2))\eps(n)n and a duality principle holds:
other component sizes are distributed as in the subcritical regime.

ARXIV:SUMMARY={We study the behavior of Random Walk in Random Environment (RWRE) on trees in
the critical case left open in previous work. Representing the random walk by
an electrical network, we assume that the ratios of resistances of neighboring
edges of a tree Gamma are i.i.d.random variables whose logarithms have mean
zero and finite variance. Then the resulting RWRE is transient if simple random
walk on Gamma is transient, but not vice versa. We obtain general transience
criteria for such walks, which are sharp for symmetric trees of polynomial
growth. In order to prove these criteria, we establish results on boundary
crossing by tree-indexed random walks. These results rely on comparison
inequalities for percolation processes on trees and on some new estimates of
boundary crossing probabilities for ordinary mean-zero finite variance random
walks in one dimension, which are of independent interest.},

ARXIV:SUMMARY={We introduce a technique using non-backtracking random walk for estimating
the spectral radius of simple random walk. This technique relates the density
of non-trivial cycles in simple random walk to that in non-backtracking random
walk. We apply this to infinite Ramanujan graphs, which are regular graphs
whose spectral radius equals that of the tree of the same degree. Kesten showed
that the only infinite Ramanujan graphs that are Cayley graphs are trees. This
result was extended to unimodular random rooted regular graphs by Ab\'ert,
Glasner and Vir\'ag. We show that an analogous result holds for all regular
graphs: the frequency of times spent by simple random walk in a non-trivial
cycle is a.s. 0 on every infinite Ramanujan graph. We also give quantitative
versions of that result, which we apply to answer another question of Ab\'ert,
Glasner and Vir\'ag, showing that on an infinite Ramanujan graph, the
probability that simple random walk encounters a short cycle tends to 0 a.s. as
the time tends to infinity.},

ARXIV:SUMMARY={Filtering---estimating the state of a partially observable Markov process
from a sequence of observations---is one of the most widely studied problems in
control theory, AI, and computational statistics. Exact computation of the
posterior distribution is generally intractable for large discrete systems and
for nonlinear continuous systems, so a good deal of effort has gone into
developing robust approximation algorithms. This paper describes a simple
stochastic approximation algorithm for filtering called {em decayed MCMC}. The
algorithm applies Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to the space of state
trajectories using a proposal distribution that favours flips of more recent
state variables. The formal analysis of the algorithm involves a generalization
of standard coupling arguments for MCMC convergence. We prove that for any
ergodic underlying Markov process, the convergence time of decayed MCMC with
inverse-polynomial decay remains bounded as the length of the observation
sequence grows. We show experimentally that decayed MCMC is at least
competitive with other approximation algorithms such as particle filtering.},

random scenery, obtained by tossing a fair coin at each vertex. A random
walker, starting from the origin, replaces the coins along its path by i.i.d.
biased coins. For which walks and dimensions can the resulting scenery be
distinguished from the original scenery? We find the answer for simple random
walk, where it does not depend on dimension, and for walks with a nonzero mean,
where a transition occurs between dimensions three and four. We also answer
this question for other types of graphs and walks, and raise several new
questions.},

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We give a probabilistic introduction to determinantal and permanental point
processes. Determinantal processes arise in physics (fermions, eigenvalues of
random matrices) and in combinatorics (nonintersecting paths, random spanning
trees). They have the striking property that the number of points in a region
$D$ is a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables, with parameters which
are eigenvalues of the relevant operator on $L^2(D)$. Moreover, any
determinantal process can be represented as a mixture of determinantal
projection processes. We give a simple explanation for these known facts, and
establish analogous representations for permanental processes, with geometric
variables replacing the Bernoulli variables. These representations lead to
simple proofs of existence criteria and central limit theorems, and unify known
results on the distribution of absolute values in certain processes with
radially symmetric distributions.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We study the diameter of $C_1$, the largest component of the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ in the emerging supercritical phase,
i.e., for $p = \frac{1+\epsilon}n$ where $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$ and
$\epsilon=o(1)$. This parameter was extensively studied for fixed $\epsilon >
0$, yet results for $\epsilon=o(1)$ outside the critical window were only
obtained very recently. Prior to this work, Riordan and Wormald gave precise
estimates on the diameter, however these did not cover the entire supercritical
regime (namely, when $\epsilon^3 n\to\infty$ arbitrarily slowly). {\L}uczak and
Seierstad estimated its order throughout this regime, yet their upper and lower
bounds differed by a factor of $1000/7$.
  We show that throughout the emerging supercritical phase, i.e. for any
$\epsilon=o(1)$ with $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$, the diameter of $C_1$ is with
high probability asymptotic to $D(\epsilon,n)=(3/\epsilon)\log(\epsilon^3 n)$.
This constitutes the first proof of the asymptotics of the diameter valid
throughout this phase. The proof relies on a recent structure result for the
supercritical giant component, which reduces the problem of estimating
distances between its vertices to the study of passage times in first-passage
percolation. The main advantage of our method is its flexibility. It also
implies that in the emerging supercritical phase the diameter of the 2-core of
$C_1$ is w.h.p. asymptotic to $(2/3)D(\epsilon,n)$, and the maximal distance in
$C_1$ between any pair of kernel vertices is w.h.p. asymptotic to
$(5/9)D(\epsilon,n)$.

Brownian motion and continuous $f$, where it was known that this dimension is
almost surely constant. The expression involves an adaptation of the parabolic
dimension previously used by Taylor and Watson to characterize polarity for the
heat equation. In the case when the graph of $f$ is a self-affine
McMullen-Bedford carpet, we obtain an explicit formula for the dimension of the
graph of $X+f$ in terms of the generating pattern. In particular, we show that
it can be strictly bigger than the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the
graph of $f$ and that of $X$. Despite the random perturbation, the Minkowski
and Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $X+f$ can disagree.},

dominates another if when the vertices of each are labeled with independent,

conditions to the problem of determining how fast a tree must grow before
first-passage percolation on the tree exhibits an explosion, that is to say,
infinitely many vertices are reached in finite time. For a tree in which each
vertex at distance n-1 from the root has f(n) offspring, f nondecreasing, an

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  In dynamical percolation, the status of every bond is refreshed according to
an independent Poisson clock. For graphs which do not percolate at criticality,
the dynamical sensitivity of this property was analyzed extensively in the last
decade. Here we focus on graphs which percolate at criticality, and investigate
the dynamical sensitivity of the infinite cluster. We first give two examples
of bounded degree graphs, one which percolates for all times at criticality and
one which has exceptional times of nonpercolation. We then make a nearly
complete analysis of this question for spherically symmetric trees with
spherically symmetric edge probabilities bounded away from 0 and 1. One
interesting regime occurs when the expected number of vertices at the nth level
that connect to the root at a fixed time is of order n(\log n)^\alpha. R. Lyons
(1990) showed that at a fixed time, there is an infinite cluster a.s. if and
only if \alpha >1. We prove that the probability that there is an infinite
cluster at all times is 1 if \alpha > 2, while this probability is 0 if
1<\alpha \le 2. Within the regime where a.s. there is an infinite cluster at
all times, there is yet another type of ``phase transition'' in the behavior of
the process: if the expected number of vertices at the nth level connecting to
the root at a fixed time is of order n^\theta with \theta > 2, then the number
of connected components of the set of times in [0,1] at which the root does not
percolate is finite a.s., while if 1<\theta < 2, then the number of such
components is infinite with positive probability.

and c>0 such that for all x,y\in G we have \|f(x)-f(y)\|\ge c\cdot
d_G(x,y)^\alpha. In particular, the Hilbert compression exponent (respectively
the equivariant Hilbert compression exponent) of G is
\alpha^*(G)=\alpha^*_{L_2}(G) (respectively \alpha^#(G)= \alpha_{L_2}^#(G)). We
show that if X has modulus of smoothness of power type p, then \alpha^#_X(G)\le
\frac{1}{p\beta^*(G)}. Here \beta^*(G) is the largest \beta\ge 0 for which
there exists a set of generators S of G and c>0 such that for all t\in \N we
have \E\big[d_G(W_t,e)\big]\ge ct^\beta, where \{W_t\}_{t=0}^\infty is the
canonical simple random walk on the Cayley graph of G determined by S, starting
at the identity element. This result is sharp when X=L_p, generalizes a theorem
of Guentner and Kaminker and answers a question posed by Tessera. We also show
that if \alpha^*(G)\ge 1/2 then \alpha^*(G\bwr \Z)\ge
\frac{2\alpha^*(G)}{2\alpha^*(G)+1}. This improves the previous bound due to
Stalder and ValetteWe deduce that if we write \Z_{(1)}= \Z and
\Z_{(k+1)}\coloneqq \Z_{(k)}\bwr \Z then
\alpha^*(\Z_{(k)})=\frac{1}{2-2^{1-k}}, and use this result to answer a
question posed by Tessera in on the relation between the Hilbert compression
exponent and the isoperimetric profile of the balls in G. We also show that the
cyclic lamplighter groups C_2\bwr C_n embed into L_1 with uniformly bounded
distortion, answering a question posed by Lee, Naor and Peres. Finally, we use
these results to show that edge Markov type need not imply Enflo type.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Given ergodic p-invariant measures {\mu_i} on the 1-torus T=R/Z, we give a
sharp condition on their entropies, guaranteeing that the entropy of the
convolution \muon converges to \log p. We also prove a variant of this result
for joinings of full entropy on \T^\N. In conjunction with a method of Host,
this yields the following. Denote \sig_q(x) = qx\pmod{1}. Then for every
p-invariant ergodic \mu with positive entropy,
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\sig_{c_n}\mu converges weak^* to Lebesgue measure
as N \goesto \infty, under a certain mild combinatorial condition on {c_k}.
(For instance, the condition is satisfied if p=10 and c_k=2^k+6^k or
c_k=2^{2^k}.) This extends a result of Johnson and Rudolph, who considered the
sequence c_k = q^k when p and q are multiplicatively independent.
  We also obtain the following corollary concerning Hausdorff dimension of sum
sets: For any sequence {S_i} of p-invariant closed subsets of T, if \sum
\dim_H(S_i) / |\log\dim_H(S_i)| = \infty, then \dim_H(S_1 + \cdots + S_n)
\goesto 1.

author, yields the sharpest bounds obtained to date on mixing times of Markov
chains in terms of isoperimetric properties of the state space (also known as
conductance bounds or Cheeger inequalities). We prove that the bounds for
mixing time in total variation obtained by Lovasz and Kannan, can be refined to
apply to the maximum relative deviation $|p^n(x,y)/\pi(y)-1|$ of the
distribution at time $n$ from the stationary distribution $\pi$. We then extend
our results to Markov chains on infinite state spaces and to continuous-time
chains. Our approach yields a direct link between isoperimetric inequalities
and heat kernel bounds; previously, this link rested on analytic estimates
known as Nash inequalities.

self-avoiding walk. It is called doubly extendable if it may be extended in
both directions simultaneously to a doubly infinite self-avoiding walk. We
prove that the connective constants for forward, backward, and doubly
extendable self-avoiding walks, denoted respectively by mu^F, mu^B, mu^FB,
exist and satisfy mu = mu^F = mu^B = mu^FB for every infinite, locally finite,
strongly connected, quasi-transitive directed graph. The proofs rely on a 1967
result of Furstenberg on dimension, and involve two different arguments
depending on whether or not the graph is unimodular.},

version. Thorisson [Ann. Probab. 24 (1996) 2057-2064] proved that there exists
a shift coupling of \Pi and \Pi^*; that is, one can select a (random) point Y
of \Pi such that translating \Pi by -Y yields a configuration whose law is that
of \Pi^*. We construct shift couplings in which Y and \Pi^* are functions of
\Pi, and prove that there is no shift coupling in which \Pi is a function of
\Pi^*. The key ingredient is a deterministic translation-invariant rule to
allocate sets of equal volume (forming a partition of R^d) to the points of
\Pi. The construction is based on the Gale-Shapley stable marriage algorithm
[Amer. Math. Monthly 69 (1962) 9-15]. Next, let \Gamma be an ergodic random
element of {0,1}^{Z^d} and let \Gamma^* be \Gamma conditioned on \Gamma(0)=1. A
shift coupling X of \Gamma and \Gamma^* is called an extra head scheme. We show
that there exists an extra head scheme which is a function of \Gamma if and
only if the marginal E[\Gamma(0)] is the reciprocal of an integer. When the law
of \Gamma is product measure and d\geq3, we prove that there exists an extra
head scheme X satisfying E\exp c\|X\|^d<\infty; this answers a question of
Holroyd and Liggett [Ann. Probab. 29 (2001) 1405-1425].

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We are given a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, where a random subset of $k$
vertices has been made into a clique, and the remaining edges are chosen
independently with probability $\tfrac12$. This random graph model is denoted
$G(n,\tfrac12,k)$. The hidden clique problem is to design an algorithm that
finds the $k$-clique in polynomial time with high probability. An algorithm due
to Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov uses spectral techniques to find the hidden
clique with high probability when $k = c \sqrt{n}$ for a sufficiently large
constant $c > 0$. Recently, an algorithm that solves the same problem was
proposed by Feige and Ron. It has the advantages of being simpler and more
intuitive, and of an improved running time of $O(n^2)$. However, the analysis
in the paper gives success probability of only $2/3$. In this paper we present
a new algorithm for finding hidden cliques that both runs in time $O(n^2)$, and
has a failure probability that is less than polynomially small.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  A {\em local graph partitioning algorithm} finds a set of vertices with small
conductance (i.e. a sparse cut) by adaptively exploring part of a large graph
$G$, starting from a specified vertex. For the algorithm to be local, its
complexity must be bounded in terms of the size of the set that it outputs,
with at most a weak dependence on the number $n$ of vertices in $G$. Previous
local partitioning algorithms find sparse cuts using random walks and
personalized PageRank. In this paper, we introduce a randomized local
partitioning algorithm that finds a sparse cut by simulating the {\em
volume-biased evolving set process}, which is a Markov chain on sets of
vertices. We prove that for any set of vertices $A$ that has conductance at
most $\phi$, for at least half of the starting vertices in $A$ our algorithm
will output (with probability at least half), a set of conductance
$O(\phi^{1/2} \log^{1/2} n)$. We prove that for a given run of the algorithm,
the expected ratio between its computational complexity and the volume of the
set that it outputs is $O(\phi^{-1/2} polylog(n))$. In comparison, the best
previous local partitioning algorithm, due to Andersen, Chung, and Lang, has
the same approximation guarantee, but a larger ratio of $O(\phi^{-1}
polylog(n))$ between the complexity and output volume. Using our local
partitioning algorithm as a subroutine, we construct a fast algorithm for
finding balanced cuts. Given a fixed value of $\phi$, the resulting algorithm
has complexity $O((m+n\phi^{-1/2}) polylog(n))$ and returns a cut with
conductance $O(\phi^{1/2} \log^{1/2} n)$ and volume at least $v_{\phi}/2$,
where $v_{\phi}$ is the largest volume of any set with conductance at most
$\phi$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We consider a planar Brownian loop $B$ that is run for a time $T$ and
conditioned on the event that its range encloses the unusually high area of
$\pi T^2$, with $T$ being large. We study the deviation of the range of the
conditioned process $X$ from a circle of radius $T$, as a model for the
fluctuation of a phase boundary. This deviation is measured by means of the
inradius and outradius of the region enclosed by the range of $X$. We prove
that in a typical realization of the conditioned measure, each of these
quantities differs from $T$ by at most $T^{2/3 + \epsilon}$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Evans defines a notion of what it means for a set B to be polar for a process
indexed by a tree. The main result herein is that a tree picked from a
Galton-Watson measure whose offspring distribution has mean m and finite
variance will almost surely have precisely the same polar sets as a
deterministic tree of the same growth rate. This implies that deterministic and
nondeterministic trees behave identically in a variety of probability models.
Mapping subsets of Euclidean space to trees and polar sets to capacity
criteria, it follows that certain random Cantor sets are capacity-equivalent to
each other and to deterministic Cantor sets. An extension to branching
processes in varying environment is also obtained.

a window of order n centered at [2(1-beta)]^{-1} n log n. For beta = 1, we
prove that the mixing time is of order n^{3/2}. For beta > 1, we study

$q\geq 3$ states and show that it undergoes a critical slowdown at an
inverse-temperature $\beta_s(q)$ strictly lower than the critical $\beta_c(q)$
for uniqueness of the thermodynamic limit. The dynamical critical $\beta_s(q)$
is the spinodal point marking the onset of metastability.
  We prove that when $\beta<\beta_s(q)$ the mixing time is asymptotically
$C(\beta, q) n \log n$ and the dynamics exhibits the cutoff phenomena, a sharp
transition in mixing, with a window of order $n$. At $\beta=\beta_s(q)$ the
dynamics no longer exhibits cutoff and its mixing obeys a power-law of order
$n^{4/3}$. For $\beta>\beta_s(q)$ the mixing time is exponentially large in
$n$. Furthermore, as $\beta \uparrow \beta_s$ with $n$, the mixing time
interpolates smoothly from subcritical to critical behavior, with the latter
reached at a scaling window of $O(n^{-2/3})$ around $\beta_s$. These results
form the first complete analysis of mixing around the critical dynamical
temperature --- including the critical power law --- for a model with a first
order phase transition.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  For d>=3, we construct a non-randomized, fair and translation-equivariant
allocation of Lebesgue measure to the points of a standard Poisson point
process in R^d, defined by allocating to each of the Poisson points its basin
of attraction with respect to the flow induced by a gravitational force field
exerted by the points of the Poisson process. We prove that this allocation
rule is economical in the sense that the "allocation diameter", defined as the
diameter X of the basin of attraction containing the origin, is a random
variable with a rapidly decaying tail. Specifically, we have the tail bound:
P(X > R) < C exp[ -c R(log R)^(alpha_d) ], for all R>2, where: alpha_d =
(d-2)/d for d>=4; alpha_3 can be taken as any number <-4/3; and C,c are
positive constants that depend on d and alpha_d. This is the first construction
of an allocation rule of Lebesgue measure to a Poisson point process with
subpolynomial decay of the tail P(X>R).

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We study the abelian sandpile growth model, where n particles are added at
the origin on a stable background configuration in Z^d. Any site with at least
2d particles then topples by sending one particle to each neighbor. We find
that with constant background height h <= 2d-2, the diameter of the set of
sites that topple has order n^{1/d}. This was previously known only for h<d.
Our proof uses a strong form of the least action principle for sandpiles, and a
novel method of background modification.
  We can extend this diameter bound to certain backgrounds in which an
arbitrarily high fraction of sites have height 2d-1. On the other hand, we show
that if the background height 2d-2 is augmented by 1 at an arbitrarily small
fraction of sites chosen independently at random, then adding finitely many
particles creates an explosion (a sandpile that never stabilizes).

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  The time it takes a random walker in a lattice to reach the origin from
another vertex $x$, has infinite mean. If the walker can restart the walk at
$x$ at will, then the minimum expected hitting time $T(x,0)$ (minimized over
restarting strategies) is finite; it was called the ``grade'' of $x$ by
Dumitriu, Tetali and Winkler. They showed that, in a more general setting, the
grade (a variant of the ``Gittins index'') plays a crucial role in control
problems involving several Markov chains. Here we establish several conjectures
of Dumitriu et al on the asymptotics of the grade in Euclidean lattices. In
particular, we show that in the planar square lattice, $T(x,0)$ is asymptotic
to $2|x|^2\log|x|$ as $|x| \to \infty$. The proof hinges on the local variance
of the potential kernel $h$ being almost constant on the level sets of $h$. We
also show how the same method yields precise second order asymptotics for
hitting times of a random walk (without restarts) in a lattice disk.

completely covered at least $\ell$ times by the SRW also has radius
n^{1/4+o(1)}. However, the largest disc completely covered by each of $\ell$
independent simple random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ after $n$ steps is only of
radius $n^{1/(2+2\sqrt{\ell})+o(1)}$. We complement this by showing that the
radius of the largest disc completely covered at least a fixed fraction
$\alpha$ of the maximum number of visits to any site during the first $n$ steps
of the SRW on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, is $n^{(1-\sqrt{\alpha})/4+o(1)}$. We also show
that almost surely, for infinitely many values of $n$ it takes about
$n^{1/2+o(1)}$ steps after step n for the SRW to reach the first previously
unvisited site (and the exponent 1/2 is sharp). This resolves a problem raised

ARXIV:SUMMARY={A planar set that contains a unit segment in every direction is called a
Kakeya set. We relate these sets to a game of pursuit on a cycle $\Z_n$. A
hunter and a rabbit move on the nodes of $\Z_n$ without seeing each other. At
each step, the hunter moves to a neighbouring vertex or stays in place, while
the rabbit is free to jump to any node. Adler et al (2003) provide strategies
for hunter and rabbit that are optimal up to constant factors and achieve
probability of capture in the first $n$ steps of order $1/\log n$. We show
these strategies yield a Kakeya set consisting of $4n$ triangles with minimal
area, (up to constant), namely $\Theta(1/\log n)$. As far as we know, this is
the first non-iterative construction of a boundary-optimal Kakeya set.
Considering the continuum analog of the game yields a construction of a random
Kakeya set from two independent standard Brownian motions $\{B(s): s \ge 0\}$
and $\{W(s): s \ge 0\}$. Let $\tau_t:=\min\{s \ge 0: B(s)=t\}$. Then
$X_t=W(\tau_t)$ is a Cauchy process, and $K:=\{(a,X_t+at) : a,t \in [0,1]\}$ is
a Kakeya set of zero area. The area of the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $K$ is as
small as possible, i.e., almost surely of order $\Theta(1/|\log \epsilon|)$.},

only finitely many of these coins have non-zero bias. Allow a simple random
walker to generate observations by tossing, at each move, the coin attached to
its current position. Then we can determine the biases {theta(z) : z in Z},
using only the outcomes of these coin tosses and no information about the path
of the random walker, up to a shift and reflection of Z. This generalizes a
result of Harris and Keane.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Consider a tree network $T$, where each edge acts as an independent copy of a
given channel $M$, and information is propagated from the root. For which $T$
and $M$ does the configuration obtained at level $n$ of $T$ typically contain
significant information on the root variable? This problem arose independently
in biology, information theory and statistical physics.
  For all $b$, we construct a channel for which the variable at the root of the
$b$-ary tree is independent of the configuration at level 2 of that tree, yet
for sufficiently large $B>b$, the mutual information between the configuration
at level $n$ of the $B$-ary tree and the root variable is bounded away from
zero. This is related to certain secret-sharing protocols.
  We improve the upper bounds on information flow for asymmetric binary
channels (which correspond to the Ising model with an external field) and for
symmetric $q$-ary channels (which correspond to Potts models).
  Let $\lam_2(M)$ denote the second largest eigenvalue of $M$, in absolute
value. A CLT of Kesten and Stigum~(1966) implies that if $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 >1$,
then the {\em census} of the variables at any level of the $b$-ary tree,
contains significant information on the root variable. We establish a converse:
if $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 < 1$, then the census of the variables at level $n$ of the
$b$-ary tree is asymptotically independent of the root variable. This contrasts
with examples where $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 <1$, yet the {\em configuration} at level
$n$ is not asymptotically independent of the root variable.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let $\mathcal{T}_n(x)$ denote the time of first visit of a point $x$ on the
lattice torus $\mathbb {Z}_n^2=\mathbb{Z}^2/n\mathbb{Z}^2$ by the simple random
walk. The size of the set of $\alpha$, $n$-late points $\mathcal{L}_n(\alpha
)=\{x\in \mathbb {Z}_n^2:\mathcal{T}_n(x)\geq \alpha \frac{4}{\pi}(n\log
n)^2\}$ is approximately $n^{2(1-\alpha)}$, for $\alpha \in (0,1)$
[$\mathcal{L}_n(\alpha)$ is empty if $\alpha >1$ and $n$ is large enough].
These sets have interesting clustering and fractal properties: we show that for
$\beta \in (0,1)$, a disc of radius $n^{\beta}$ centered at nonrandom $x$
typically contains about $n^{2\beta (1-\alpha /\beta ^2)}$ points from
$\mathcal{L}_n(\alpha)$ (and is empty if $\beta <\sqrt{\alpha} $), whereas
choosing the center $x$ of the disc uniformly in $\mathcal{L}_n(\alpha)$ boosts
the typical number of $\alpha, n$-late points in it to $n^{2\beta (1-\alpha)}$.
We also estimate the typical number of pairs of $\alpha$, $n$-late points
within distance $n^{\beta}$ of each other; this typical number can be
significantly smaller than the expected number of such pairs, calculated by
Brummelhuis and Hilhorst [Phys. A 176 (1991) 387--408]. On the other hand, our
results show that the number of ordered pairs of late points within distance
$n^{\beta}$ of each other is larger than what one might predict by multiplying
the total number of late points, by the number of late points in a disc of
radius $n^{\beta}$ centered at a typical late point.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  A metric space $X$ has {\em Markov type} 2, if for any reversible
finite-state Markov chain $\{Z_t\}$ (with $Z_0$ chosen according to the
stationary distribution) and any map $f$ from the state space to $X$, the
distance $D_t$ from $f(Z_0)$ to $f(Z_t)$ satisfies $\E(D_t^2) \le K^2 t
\E(D_1^2)$ for some $K=K(X)<\infty$. This notion is due to K. Ball (1992), who
showed its importance for the Lipschitz extension problem. However until now,
only Hilbert space (and its bi-Lipschitz equivalents) were known to have Markov
type 2. We show that every Banach space with modulus of smoothness of power
type 2 (in particular, $L_p$ for $p>2$) has Markov type 2; this proves a
conjecture of Ball. We also show that trees, hyperbolic groups and simply
connected Riemannian manifolds of pinched negative curvature have Markov type
2. Our results are applied to settle several conjectures on Lipschitz
extensions and embeddings. In particular, we answer a question posed by Johnson
and Lindenstrauss in 1982, by showing that for $1<q<2<p<\infty$, any Lipschitz
mapping from a subset of $L_p$ to $L_q$ has a Lipschitz extension defined on
all of $L_p$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  For two metric spaces X and Y, say that X {threshold-embeds} into Y if there
exist a number K > 0 and a family of Lipschitz maps $f_{\tau} : X \to Y : \tau
> 0 \}$ such that for every $x,y \in X$, \[ d_X(x,y) \geq \tau =>
d_Y(f_{\tau}(x),f_{\tau}(y)) \geq \|\varphi_{\tau}\|_{\Lip} \tau/K \] where
$\|f_{\tau}\|_{\Lip}$ denotes the Lipschitz constant of $f_{\tau}$. We show
that if a metric space X threshold-embeds into a Hilbert space, then X has
Markov type 2. As a consequence, planar graph metrics and doubling metrics have
Markov type 2, answering questions of Naor, Peres, Schramm, and Sheffield. More
generally, if a metric space X threshold-embeds into a p-uniformly smooth
Banach space, then X has Markov type p. This suggests some non-linear analogs
of Kwapien's theorem. For instance, a subset $X \subseteq L_1$ threshold-embeds
into Hilbert space if and only if X has Markov type 2.

exact up to a factor of 2. These estimates are applied to random walks on

and percolation on trees.

ARXIV:SUMMARY={Auctions in which agents' payoffs are random variables have received
increased attention in recent years. In particular, recent work in algorithmic
mechanism design has produced mechanisms employing internal randomization,
partly in response to limitations on deterministic mechanisms imposed by
computational complexity. For many of these mechanisms, which are often
referred to as truthful-in-expectation, incentive compatibility is contingent
on the assumption that agents are risk-neutral. These mechanisms have been
criticized on the grounds that this assumption is too strong, because "real"
agents are typically risk averse, and moreover their precise attitude towards
risk is typically unknown a-priori. In response, researchers in algorithmic
mechanism design have sought the design of universally-truthful mechanisms ---
mechanisms for which incentive-compatibility makes no assumptions regarding
agents' attitudes towards risk.
  We show that any truthful-in-expectation mechanism can be generically
transformed into a mechanism that is incentive compatible even when agents are
risk averse, without modifying the mechanism's allocation rule. The transformed
mechanism does not require reporting of agents' risk profiles. Equivalently,
our result can be stated as follows: Every (randomized) allocation rule that is
implementable in dominant strategies when players are risk neutral is also
implementable when players are endowed with an arbitrary and unknown concave
utility function for money.},

  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)},
ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Minimal spanning forests on infinite graphs are weak limits of minimal
spanning trees from finite subgraphs. These limits can be taken with free or
wired boundary conditions and are denoted FMSF (free minimal spanning forest)
and WMSF (wired minimal spanning forest), respectively. The WMSF is also the
union of the trees that arise from invasion percolation started at all
vertices. We show that on any Cayley graph where critical percolation has no
infinite clusters, all the component trees in the WMSF have one end a.s. In
$\mathbb{Z}^d$ this was proved by Alexander [Ann. Probab. 23 (1995) 87--104],
but a different method is needed for the nonamenable case. We also prove that
the WMSF components are ``thin'' in a different sense, namely, on any graph,
each component tree in the WMSF has $p_{\mathrm{c}}=1$ a.s., where
$p_{\mathrm{c}}$ denotes the critical probability for having an infinite
cluster in Bernoulli percolation. On the other hand, the FMSF is shown to be
``thick'': on any connected graph, the union of the FMSF and independent
Bernoulli percolation (with arbitrarily small parameter) is a.s. connected. In
conjunction with a recent result of Gaboriau, this implies that in any Cayley
graph, the expected degree of the FMSF is at least the expected degree of the
FSF (the weak limit of uniform spanning trees). We also show that the number of
infinite clusters for Bernoulli($p_{\mathrm{u}}$) percolation is at most the
number of components of the FMSF, where $p_{\mathrm{u}}$ denotes the critical
probability for having a unique infinite cluster. Finally, an example is given
to show that the minimal spanning tree measure does not have negative
associations.

$n\log n/f(\Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree and $f(\Delta) =
\Theta(\Delta \log^2 \Delta)$. Their result applies to more general spin
systems, and in that generality, they showed that some dependence on $\Delta$
is necessary. In this paper, we focus on the ferromagnetic Ising model and
prove that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics on any $n$-vertex graph is at
least $(1/4+o(1))n \log n$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  In the heat-bath Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on the lattice,
physicists believe that the spectral gap of the continuous-time chain exhibits
the following behavior. For some critical inverse-temperature $\beta_c$, the
inverse-gap is bounded for $\beta < \beta_c$, polynomial in the surface area
for $\beta = \beta_c$ and exponential in it for $\beta > \beta_c$. This has
been proved for $\Z^2$ except at criticality. So far, the only underlying
geometry where the critical behavior has been confirmed is the complete graph.
Recently, the dynamics for the Ising model on a regular tree, also known as the
Bethe lattice, has been intensively studied. The facts that the inverse-gap is
bounded for $\beta < \beta_c$ and exponential for $\beta > \beta_c$ were
established, where $\beta_c$ is the critical spin-glass parameter, and the
tree-height $h$ plays the role of the surface area.
  In this work, we complete the picture for the inverse-gap of the Ising model
on the $b$-ary tree, by showing that it is indeed polynomial in $h$ at
criticality. The degree of our polynomial bound does not depend on $b$, and
furthermore, this result holds under any boundary condition. We also obtain
analogous bounds for the mixing-time of the chain. In addition, we study the
near critical behavior, and show that for $\beta > \beta_c$, the inverse-gap
and mixing-time are both $\exp[\Theta((\beta-\beta_c) h)]$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ be the largest component of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi
random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. The mixing time of random walk on $\mathcal
{C}_1$ in the strictly supercritical regime, $p=c/n$ with fixed $c>1$, was
shown to have order $\log^2n$ by Fountoulakis and Reed, and independently by
Benjamini, Kozma and Wormald. In the critical window, $p=(1+\varepsilon)/n$
where $\lambda=\varepsilon^3n$ is bounded, Nachmias and Peres proved that the
mixing time on $\mathcal{C}_1$ is of order $n$. However, it was unclear how to
interpolate between these results, and estimate the mixing time as the giant
component emerges from the critical window. Indeed, even the asymptotics of the
diameter of $\mathcal{C}_1$ in this regime were only recently obtained by
Riordan and Wormald, as well as the present authors and Kim. In this paper, we
show that for $p=(1+\varepsilon)/n$ with $\lambda=\varepsilon^3n\to\infty$ and
$\lambda=o(n)$, the mixing time on $\mathcal{C}_1$ is with high probability of
order $(n/\lambda)\log^2\lambda$. In addition, we show that this is the order
of the largest mixing time over all components, both in the slightly
supercritical and in the slightly subcritical regime [i.e.,
$p=(1-\varepsilon)/n$ with $\lambda$ as above].

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Given a finite graph G, a vertex of the lamplighter graph consists of a
zero-one labeling of the vertices of G, and a marked vertex of G. For
transitive graphs G, we show that, up to constants, the relaxation time for
simple random walk in corresponding lamplighter graph is the maximal hitting
time for simple random walk in G, while the mixing time in total variation on
the lamplighter graph is the expected cover time on G. The mixing time in the
uniform metric on the lamplighter graph admits a sharp threshold, and equals
|G| multiplied by the relaxation time on G, up to a factor of log |G|.
  For the lamplighter group over the discrete two dimensional torus of
sidelength n, the relaxation time is of order n^2 log n, the total variation
mixing time is of order n^2 log^2 n, and the uniform mixing time is of order
n^4. In dimension d>2, the relaxation time is of order n^d, the total variation
mixing time is of order n^d log n, and the uniform mixing time is of order
n^{d+2}. These are the first examples we know of of finite transitive graphs
with uniformly bounded degrees where these three mixing time parameters are of
different orders of magnitude.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Given a (known) function $f:[0,1] \to (0,1)$, we consider the problem of
simulating a coin with probability of heads $f(p)$ by tossing a coin with
unknown heads probability $p$, as well as a fair coin, $N$ times each, where
$N$ may be random. The work of Keane and O'Brien (1994) implies that such a
simulation scheme with the probability $\P_p(N<\infty)$ equal to 1 exists iff
$f$ is continuous. Nacu and Peres (2005) proved that $f$ is real analytic in an
open set $S \subset (0,1)$ iff such a simulation scheme exists with the
probability $\P_p(N>n)$ decaying exponentially in $n$ for every $p \in S$. We
prove that for $\alpha>0$ non-integer, $f$ is in the space $C^\alpha [0,1]$ if
and only if a simulation scheme as above exists with $\P_p(N>n) \le C
(\Delta_n(p))^\alpha$, where $\Delta_n(x)\eqbd \max \{\sqrt{x(1-x)/n},1/n \}$.
The key to the proof is a new result in approximation theory:
  Let $\B_n$ be the cone of univariate polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein
coefficients of degree $n$. We show that a function $f:[0,1] \to (0,1)$ is in
$C^\alpha [0,1]$ if and only if $f$ has a series representation
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty F_n$ with $F_n \in \B_n$ and $\sum_{k>n} F_k(x) \le
C(\Delta_n(x))^\alpha$ for all $ x \in [0,1]$ and $n \ge 1$. We also provide a
counterexample to a theorem stated without proof by Lorentz (1963), who claimed
that if some $\phi_n \in \B_n$ satisfy $|f(x)-\phi_n(x)| \le C
(\Delta_n(x))^\alpha$ for all $ x \in [0,1]$ and $n \ge 1$, then $f \in
C^\alpha [0,1]$.

probability p of ``heads'').
  For which functions f is it possible to simulate an f(p)-coin?; This question
was raised by S. Asmussen and J. Propp. A simple simulation scheme for the
constant function 1/2 was described by von Neumann (1951); this scheme can be
easily implemented using a finite automaton. We prove that in general, an
f(p)-coin can be simulated by a finite automaton for all p in (0,1), if and
only if f is a rational function over Q. We also show that if an f(p)-coin can
be simulated by a pushdown automaton, then f is an algebraic function over Q;
however, pushdown automata can simulate f(p)-coins for certain non-rational
functions such as the square root of p. These results complement the work of
Keane and O'Brien (1994), who determined the functions $f$ for which an
f(p)-coin can be simulated when there are no computational restrictions on the
simulation scheme.

constant retention probabilities to the case of retention probabilities
approaching 1.

ARXIV:SUMMARY={Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm (2001) showed that weighted majority functions
of $n$ independent unbiased bits are uniformly stable under noise: when each
bit is flipped with probability $\epsilon$, the probability $p_\epsilon$ that
the weighted majority changes is at most $C\epsilon^{1/4}$. They asked what is
the best possible exponent that could replace 1/4. We prove that the answer is
1/2. The upper bound obtained for $p_\epsilon$ is within a factor of
$\sqrt{\pi/2}+o(1)$ from the known lower bound when $\epsilon \to 0$ and
$n\epsilon\to \infty$.},

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Maximum satisfiability is a canonical NP-hard optimization problem that
appears empirically hard for random instances. Let us say that a Conjunctive
normal form (CNF) formula consisting of $k$-clauses is $p$-satisfiable if there
exists a truth assignment satisfying $1-2^{-k}+p 2^{-k}$ of all clauses
(observe that every $k$-CNF is 0-satisfiable). Also, let $F_k(n,m)$ denote a
random $k$-CNF on $n$ variables formed by selecting uniformly and independently
$m$ out of all possible $k$-clauses. It is easy to prove that for every $k>1$
and every $p$ in $(0,1]$, there is $R_k(p)$ such that if $r >R_k(p)$, then the
probability that $F_k(n,rn)$ is $p$-satisfiable tends to 0 as $n$ tends to
infinity. We prove that there exists a sequence $\delta_k \to 0$ such that if
$r <(1-\delta_k) R_k(p)$ then the probability that $F_k(n,rn)$is
$p$-satisfiable tends to 1 as $n$ tends to infinity. The sequence $\delta_k$
tends to 0 exponentially fast in $k$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Given a Poisson point process of unit masses (``stars'') in dimension d>=3,
Newtonian gravity partitions space into domains of attraction (cells) of equal
volume. In earlier work, we showed the diameters of these cells have
exponential tails. Here we analyze the quantitative geometry of the cells and
show that their large deviations occur at the stretched-exponential scale. More
precisely, the probability that mass exp(-R^gamma) in a cell travels distance R
decays like exp(-R^f_d(gamma)) where we identify the functions f_d exactly.
These functions are piecewise smooth and the discontinuities of f_d' represent
phase transitions. In dimension d=3, the large deviation is due to a ``distant
attracting galaxy'' but a phase transition occurs when f_3(gamma)=1 (at that
point, the fluctuations due to individual stars dominate). When d>=5, the large
deviation is due to a thin tube (a ``wormhole'') along which the star density
increases monotonically, until the point f_d(gamma)=1 (where again fluctuations
due to individual stars dominate). In dimension 4 we find a double phase
transition, where the transition between low-dimensional behavior (attracting
galaxy) and high-dimensional behavior (wormhole) occurs at gamma=4/3.
  As consequences, we determine the tail behavior of the distance from a star
to a uniform point in its cell, and prove a sharp lower bound for the tail
probability of the cell's diameter, matching our earlier upper bound.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We consider first-passage percolation on the two-dimensional integer lattice
Z^2 with passage times that are IID exponentials of mean one. It has been
conjectured, based on numerical evidence, that the variance of the time T(0,n)
to reach the vertex (0,n) is of order n^{2/3}. Kesten showed that the variance
of T(0,n) is at O(n). He also noted that the variance is bounded away from
zero. This note improves the lower bound on the variance of T(0,n) to C log n.
Simultaneously and independently, Newman and Piza have achieved the same result
for {0,1}-valued passage times. Their methods extend to more general passage
times, while ours work only for exponential times. On the other hand, our
theorem shows that the variance comes from fluctuations of nonvanishing
probability in the sense that, as n->infty, the law of T(0,n) is not tight
about its median. Very recently, Newman and Piza showed that the log n may be
improved to a power of n for directions in which the shape is not flat (it is
not known whether the shape can be flat in any direction). As pointed out to us
by Harry Kesten, in the exponential case this may also be obtained via the
method given here.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Suppose that red and blue points occur as independent homogeneous Poisson
processes in R^d. We investigate translation-invariant schemes for perfectly
matching the red points to the blue points. For any such scheme in dimensions
d=1,2, the matching distance X from a typical point to its partner must have
infinite d/2-th moment, while in dimensions d>=3 there exist schemes where X
has finite exponential moments. The Gale-Shapley stable marriage is one natural
matching scheme, obtained by iteratively matching mutually closest pairs. A
principal result of this paper is a power law upper bound on the matching
distance X for this scheme. A power law lower bound holds also. In particular,
stable marriage is close to optimal (in tail behavior) in d=1, but far from
optimal in d>=3. For the problem of matching Poisson points of a single color
to each other, in d=1 there exist schemes where X has finite exponential
moments, but if we insist that the matching is a deterministic factor of the
point process then X must have infinite mean.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We study models of spatial growth processes where initially there are sources
of growth (indicated by the colour green) and sources of a growth-stopping
(paralyzing) substance (indicated by red). The green sources expand and may
merge with others (there is no `inter-green' competition). The red substance
remains passive as long as it is isolated. However, when a green cluster comes
in touch with the red substance, it is immediately invaded by the latter, stops
growing and starts to act as red substance itself. In our main model space is
represented by a graph, of which initially each vertex is randomly green, red
or white (vacant), and the growth of the green clusters is similar to that in
first-passage percolation. The main issues we investigate are whether the model
is well-defined on an infinite graph (e.g. the $d$-dimensional cubic lattice),
and what can be said about the distribution of the size of a green cluster just
before it is paralyzed. We show that, if the initial density of red vertices is
positive, and that of white vertices is sufficiently small, the model is indeed
well-defined and the above distribution has an exponential tail. In fact, we
believe this to be true whenever the initial density of red is positive. This
research also led to a relation between invasion percolation and critical
Bernoulli percolation which seems to be of independent interest.

the edges of a graph G are either open or closed and refresh their status at
rate \mu\ while at the same time a random walker moves on G at rate 1 but only
along edges which are open. On the d-dimensional torus with side length n, we
prove that in the subcritical regime, the mixing times for both the full system
and the random walker are n^2/\mu\ up to constants. We also obtain results
concerning mean squared displacement and hitting times. Finally, we show that
the usual recurrence transience dichotomy for the lattice Z^d holds for this
model as well.},

respective colors on the hexagons of a rhombus-shaped hexagonal grid. Black
wins by completing a crossing between two opposite edges, while White wins by
completing a crossing between the other pair of opposite edges. Although
ordinary Hex is famously difficult to analyze, Random-Turn Hex--in which
players toss a coin before each turn to decide who gets to place the next
stone--has a simple optimal strategy. It belongs to a general class of
random-turn games--called selection games--in which the expected payoff when
both players play the random-turn game optimally is the same as when both
players play randomly. We also describe the optimal strategy and study the
expected length of the game under optimal play for Random-Turn Hex and several
other selection games.

tree $T = (V,E)$ with irreducible edge transition matrix $M$, where $b \geq 2$,
$k \geq 2$ and $[k] = \{1,...,k\}$. We denote by $L_n$ the level-$n$ vertices
of $T$. Assume $M$ has a real second-largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue
$\lambda$ with corresponding real eigenvector $\nu \neq 0$. Letting $\sigma_v =
\nu_{\xi_v}$, we consider the following root-state estimator, which was
introduced by Mossel and Peres (2003) in the context of the "recontruction
problem" on trees: \begin{equation*} S_n = (b\lambda)^{-n} \sum_{x\in L_n}
\sigma_x. \end{equation*} As noted by Mossel and Peres, when $b\lambda^2 > 1$
(the so-called Kesten-Stigum reconstruction phase) the quantity $S_n$ has
uniformly bounded variance. Here, we give bounds on the moment-generating
functions of $S_n$ and $S_n^2$ when $b\lambda^2 > 1$. Our results have
implications for the inference of evolutionary trees.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let $C_a$ be the central Cantor set obtained by removing a central interval
of length $1-2a$ from the unit interval, and continuing this process
inductively on each of the remaining two intervals. We prove that if $\log
b/\log a$ is irrational, then \[ \dim(C_a+C_b) = \min(\dim(C_a) + \dim(C_b),1),
\] where $\dim$ is Hausdorff dimension. More generally, given two self-similar
sets $K,K'$ in $\RR$ and a scaling parameter $s>0$, if the dimension of the
arithmetic sum $K+sK'$ is strictly smaller than $\dim(K)+\dim(K') \le 1$
(``geometric resonance''), then there exists $r<1$ such that all contraction
ratios of the similitudes defining $K$ and $K'$ are powers of $r$ (``algebraic
resonance''). Our method also yields a new result on the projections of planar
self-similar sets generated by an iterated function system that includes a
scaled irrational rotation.

in D. Further, in both models we prove that the outside says "nothing more"

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We study the scaling limits of three different aggregation models on Z^d:
internal DLA, in which particles perform random walks until reaching an
unoccupied site; the rotor-router model, in which particles perform
deterministic analogues of random walks; and the divisible sandpile, in which
each site distributes its excess mass equally among its neighbors. As the
lattice spacing tends to zero, all three models are found to have the same
scaling limit, which we describe as the solution to a certain PDE free boundary
problem in R^d. In particular, internal DLA has a deterministic scaling limit.
We find that the scaling limits are quadrature domains, which have arisen
independently in many fields such as potential theory and fluid dynamics. Our
results apply both to the case of multiple point sources and to the
Diaconis-Fulton smash sum of domains.

ARXIV:SUMMARY={In the cyclic-to-random shuffle, we are given n cards arranged in a circle.
At step k, we exchange the k'th card along the circle with a uniformly chosen
random card. The problem of determining the mixing time of the cyclic-to-random
shuffle was raised by Aldous and Diaconis in 1986. Recently, Mironov used this
shuffle as a model for the cryptographic system known as ``RC4'' and proved an
upper bound of O(n log n) for the mixing time. We prove a matching lower bound,
thus establishing that the mixing time is indeed of order $\Theta(n \log n)$.
We also prove an upper bound of O(n log n) for the mixing time of any
``semi-random transposition shuffle'', i.e., any shuffle in which a random card
is exchanged with another card chosen according to an arbitrary (deterministic
or random) rule. To prove our lower bound, we exhibit an explicit
complex-valued test function which typically takes very different values for
permutations arising from the cyclic-to-random-shuffle and for uniform random
permutations; we expect that this test function may be useful in future
analysis of RC4. Perhaps surprisingly, the proof hinges on the fact that the
function exp(z)-1 has nonzero fixed points in the complex plane. A key insight
from our work is the importance of complex analysis tools for uncovering
structure in nonreversible Markov chains.},

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  The rotor-router model is a deterministic analogue of random walk. It can be
used to define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We prove
that the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which
is stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\omega_d r^d$
sites, where $\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\R^d$, we show that
the inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\log r)$, while the
outradius is at most $r+O(r^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related
model, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a
Euclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total
mass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\pi
r^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\sqrt{3}$, and the
outradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne
and Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let \Xi be a discrete set in R^d. Call the elements of \Xi centers. The
well-known Voronoi tessellation partitions R^d into polyhedral regions (of
varying volumes) by allocating each site of R^d to the closest center. Here we
study allocations of R^d to \Xi in which each center attempts to claim a region
of equal volume \alpha.
  We focus on the case where \Xi arises from a Poisson process of unit
intensity. It was proved in math.PR/0505668 that there is a unique allocation
which is stable in the sense of the Gale-Shapley marriage problem. We study the
distance X from a typical site to its allocated center in the stable
allocation.
  The model exhibits a phase transition in the appetite \alpha. In the critical
case \alpha=1 we prove a power law upper bound on X in dimension d=1. It is an
open problem to prove any upper bound in d\geq 2. (Power law lower bounds were
proved in math.PR/0505668 for all d). In the non-critical cases \alpha<1 and
\alpha>1 we prove exponential upper bounds on X.

conditions: all plus, free and spin-glass. In each case, we determine when the
root is influenced by the boundary values in the limit as the boundary recedes
to infinity. We obtain exact capacity criteria that govern behavior at critical
temperatures. For plus boundary conditions, an $L^3$ capacity arises. In
particular, on a spherically symmetric tree that has $n^{\alpha}b^n$ vertices
at level $n$ (up to bounded factors), we prove that there is a unique Gibbs
measure for the ferromagnetic Ising model at the relevant critical temperature
if and only if $\alpha\le1/2$. Our proofs are based on a new link between
nonlinear recursions on trees and $L^p$ capacities.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  The cover time of a graph is a celebrated example of a parameter that is easy
to approximate using a randomized algorithm, but for which no constant factor
deterministic polynomial time approximation is known. A breakthrough due to
Kahn, Kim, Lovasz and Vu yielded a (log log n)^2 polynomial time approximation.
We refine this upper bound, and show that the resulting bound is sharp and
explicitly computable in random graphs. Cooper and Frieze showed that the cover
time of the largest component of the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,c/n) in the
supercritical regime with c>1 fixed, is asymptotic to f(c) n \log^2 n, where
f(c) tends to 1 as c tends to 1. However, our new bound implies that the cover
time for the critical Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,1/n) has order n, and shows
how the cover time evolves from the critical window to the supercritical phase.
Our general estimate also yields the order of the cover time for a variety of
other concrete graphs, including critical percolation clusters on the Hamming
hypercube {0,1}^n, on high-girth expanders, and on tori Z_n^d for fixed large
d. For the graphs we consider, our results show that the blanket time,
introduced by Winkler and Zuckerman, is within a constant factor of the cover
time. Finally, we prove that for any connected graph, adding an edge can
increase the cover time by at most a factor of 4.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We consider Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on the complete graph on $n$
vertices, known as the Curie-Weiss model. It is well-known that the mixing-time
in the high temperature regime ($\beta < 1$) has order $n\log n$, whereas the
mixing-time in the case $\beta > 1$ is exponential in $n$. Recently, Levin,
Luczak and Peres proved that for any fixed $\beta < 1$ there is cutoff at time
$[2(1-\beta)]^{-1} n\log n$ with a window of order $n$, whereas the mixing-time
at the critical temperature $\beta=1$ is $\Theta(n^{3/2})$. It is natural to
ask how the mixing-time transitions from $\Theta(n\log n)$ to $\Theta(n^{3/2})$
and finally to $\exp(\Theta(n))$. That is, how does the mixing-time behave when
$\beta=\beta(n)$ is allowed to tend to 1 as $n\to\infty$.
  In this work, we obtain a complete characterization of the mixing-time of the
dynamics as a function of the temperature, as it approaches its critical point
$\beta_c=1$. In particular, we find a scaling window of order $1/\sqrt{n}$
around the critical temperature. In the high temperature regime, $\beta = 1 -
\delta$ for some $0 < \delta < 1$ so that $\delta^2 n \to\infty$ with $n$, the
mixing-time has order $(n/\delta)\log(\delta^2 n)$, and exhibits cutoff with
constant 1/2 and window size $n/\delta$. In the critical window, $\beta = 1\pm
\delta$ where $\delta^2 n$ is O(1), there is no cutoff, and the mixing-time has
order $n^{3/2}$. At low temperature, $\beta = 1 + \delta$ for $\delta > 0$ with
$\delta^2 n \to\infty$ and $\delta=o(1)$, there is no cutoff, and the mixing
time has order $(n/\delta)\exp(({3/4}+o(1))\delta^2 n)$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let $C_n$ be the $n$-th generation in the construction of the middle-half
Cantor set. The Cartesian square $K_n$ of $C_n$ consists of $4^n$ squares of
side-length $4^{-n}$. The chance that a long needle thrown at random in the
unit square will meet $K_n$ is essentially the average length of the
projections of $K_n$, also known as the Favard length of $K_n$. A classical
theorem of Besicovitch implies that the Favard length of $K_n$ tends to zero.
It is still an open problem to determine its exact rate of decay. Until
recently, the only explicit upper bound was $\exp(- c\log_* n)$, due to Peres
and Solomyak. ($\log_* n$ is the number of times one needs to take log to
obtain a number less than 1 starting from $n$). We obtain a power law bound by
combining analytic and combinatorial ideas.

property that for any planar Borel set $A$ with positive Hausdorff measure in
gauge $\phi$, the projection of $A$ to almost every line has positive length.
We show that integrability near zero of $\phi(r)/(r^2)$, which is known to be
sufficient for this property, is also necessary if $\phi$ is regularly varying.
Our proof is based on a random construction adapted to the gauge function.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We show that with probability 1, the trace B[0,1] of Brownian motion in
space, has positive capacity with respect to exactly the same kernels as the
unit square. More precisely, the energy of occupation measure on B[0,1] in the
kernel f(|x-y|), is bounded above and below by constant multiples of the energy
of Lebesgue measure on the unit square. (The constants are random, but do not
depend on the kernel.) As an application, we give almost-sure asymptotics for
the probability that an alpha-stable process approaches within epsilon of
B[0,1], conditional on B[0,1]. The upper bound on energy is based on a strong
law for the approximate self-intersections of the Brownian path. We also prove
analogous capacity estimates for planar Brownian motion and for the zero-set of
one-dimensional Brownian motion.

$\|f(x)-f(y)\|_2\ge cd(x,y)^\alpha.$ In \cite{AGS06} it was shown that the
Hilbert compression exponent of the wreath product $\Z\bwr \Z $ is at most
$\frac34$, and in \cite{NP07} was proved that this exponent is at least
$\frac23$. Here we show that $\frac23$ is the correct value. Our proof is based
on an application of K. Ball's notion of Markov type.

simple planar random walk $X$, up till step $n$. Let $X'$ be another simple
planar random walk independent of $X$. We show that for any $0<b<1/(2 \pi)$,
there are $n^{1-2\pi b+o(1)}$ points $x \in {\bf Z}^2$ for which
$L_n^{X}(x)L_n^{X'}(x)\geq b^2 (\log n)^4$. This is the discrete counterpart of
our main result, that for any $a<1$, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of {\it
thick intersection points} $x$ for which $\limsup_{r \to 0} {\mathcal
I}(x,r)/(r^2|\log r|^4)=a^2$, is almost surely $2-2a$. Here ${\mathcal I}(x,r)$
is the projected intersection local time measure of the disc of radius $r$
centered at $x$ for two independent planar Brownian motions run till time 1.
The proofs rely on a `multi-scale refinement' of the second moment method. In
addition, we also consider analogous problems where we replace one of the
Brownian motions by a transient stable process, or replace the disc of radius
$r$ centered at $x$ by $x+rK$ for general sets $K$.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let $U\subseteq\mathbf{C}$ be a bounded domain with smooth boundary and let
$F$ be an instance of the continuum Gaussian free field on $U$ with respect to
the Dirichlet inner product $\int_U\nabla f(x)\cdot \nabla g(x)\,dx$. The set
$T(a;U)$ of $a$-thick points of $F$ consists of those $z\in U$ such that the
average of $F$ on a disk of radius $r$ centered at $z$ has growth
$\sqrt{a/\pi}\log\frac{1}{r}$ as $r\to 0$. We show that for each $0\leq a\leq2$
the Hausdorff dimension of $T(a;U)$ is almost surely $2-a$, that
$\nu_{2-a}(T(a;U))=\infty$ when $0<a\leq2$ and $\nu_2(T(0;U))=\nu_2(U)$ almost
surely, where $\nu_{\alpha}$ is the Hausdorff-$\alpha$ measure, and that
$T(a;U)$ is almost surely empty when $a>2$. Furthermore, we prove that $T(a;U)$
is invariant under conformal transformations in an appropriate sense. The
notion of a thick point is connected to the Liouville quantum gravity measure
with parameter $\gamma$ given formally by $\Gamma(dz)=e^{\sqrt{2\pi}\gamma
F(z)}\,dz$ considered by Duplantier and Sheffield.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  The cutoff phenomenon describes a case where a Markov chain exhibits a sharp
transition in its convergence to stationarity. In 1996, Diaconis surveyed this
phenomenon, and asked how one could recognize its occurrence in families of
finite ergodic Markov chains. In 2004, the third author noted that a necessary
condition for cutoff in a family of reversible chains is that the product of
the mixing-time and spectral-gap tends to infinity, and conjectured that in
many settings, this condition should also be sufficient. Diaconis and
Saloff-Coste (2006) verified this conjecture for continuous-time
birth-and-death chains, started at an endpoint, with convergence measured in
separation. It is natural to ask whether the conjecture holds for these chains
in the more widely used total-variation distance.
  In this work, we confirm the above conjecture for all continuous-time or lazy
discrete-time birth-and-death chains, with convergence measured via
total-variation distance. Namely, if the product of the mixing-time and
spectral-gap tends to infinity, the chains exhibit cutoff at the maximal
hitting time of the stationary distribution median, with a window of at most
the geometric mean between the relaxation-time and mixing-time.
  In addition, we show that for any lazy (or continuous-time) birth-and-death
chain with stationary distribution $\pi$, the separation $1 - p^t(x,y)/\pi(y)$
is maximized when $x,y$ are the endpoints. Together with the above results,
this implies that total-variation cutoff is equivalent to separation cutoff in
any family of such chains.

whenever the wedge is transient. This solves a question raised by O. Haggstrom

equivalent to the (a.s.) existence of a finite energy flow on the supercritical
percolation cluster. This solves a question of C. Hoffman.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Fix a bounded domain Omega in R^d, a continuous function F on the boundary of
Omega, and constants epsilon>0, p>1, and q>1 with p^{-1} + q^{-1} = 1. For each
x in Omega, let u^epsilon(x) be the value for player I of the following
two-player, zero-sum game. The initial game position is x. At each stage, a
fair coin is tossed and the player who wins the toss chooses a vector v of
length at most epsilon to add to the game position, after which a random
``noise vector'' with mean zero and variance (q/p)|v|^2 in each orthogonal
direction is also added. The game ends when the game position reaches some y on
the boundary of Omega, and player I's payoff is F(y).
  We show that (for sufficiently regular Omega) as epsilon tends to zero the
functions u^epsilon converge uniformly to the unique p-harmonic extension of F.
Using a modified game (in which epsilon gets smaller as the game position
approaches the boundary), we prove similar statements for general bounded
domains Omega and resolutive functions F.
  These games and their variants interpolate between the tug of war games
studied by Peres, Schramm, Sheffield, and Wilson (p=infinity) and the
motion-by-curvature games introduced by Spencer and studied by Kohn and Serfaty
(p=1). They generalize the relationship between Brownian motion and the
ordinary Laplacian and yield new results about p-capacity and p-harmonic
measure.

the game after n steps converge in the continuous case and the case of finite
graphs with loops. Using this we prove the existence of solutions to the
infinity Laplace equation with vanishing Neumann boundary condition.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Let ${n_k}$ be an increasing lacunary sequence, i.e., $n_{k+1}/n_k>1+r$ for
some $r>0$. In 1987, P. Erdos asked for the chromatic number of a graph $G$ on
the integers, where two integers $a,b$ are connected by an edge iff their
difference $|a-b|$ is in the sequence ${n_k}$. Y. Katznelson found a connection
to a Diophantine approximation problem (also due to Erdos): the existence of
$x$ in $(0,1)$ such that all the multiples $n_j x$ are at least distance
$\delta(x)>0$ from the set of integers. Katznelson bounded the chromatic number
of $G$ by $Cr^{-2}|\log r|$. We apply the Lov\'asz local lemma to establish
that $\delta(x)>cr|\log r|^{-1}$ for some $x$, which implies that the chromatic
number of $G$ is at most $Cr^{-1} |\log r|$. This is sharp up to the
logarithmic factor.

ARXIV:SUMMARY={Suppose that $\CG$ is a finite, connected graph and $X$ is a lazy random walk
on $\CG$. The lamplighter chain $X^\diamond$ associated with $X$ is the random
walk on the wreath product $\CG^\diamond = \Z_2 \wr \CG$, the graph whose
vertices consist of pairs $(f,x)$ where $f$ is a labeling of the vertices of
$\CG$ by elements of $\Z_2$ and $x$ is a vertex in $\CG$. There is an edge
between $(f,x)$ and $(g,y)$ in $\CG^\diamond$ if and only if $x$ is adjacent to
$y$ in $\CG$ and $f(z) = g(z)$ for all $z \neq x,y$. In each step, $X^\diamond$
moves from a configuration $(f,x)$ by updating $x$ to $y$ using the transition
rule of $X$ and then sampling both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ according to the uniform
distribution on $\Z_2$; $f(z)$ for $z \neq x,y$ remains unchanged. We give
matching upper and lower bounds on the uniform mixing time of $X^\diamond$
provided $\CG$ satisfies mild hypotheses. In particular, when $\CG$ is the
hypercube $\Z_2^d$, we show that the uniform mixing time of $X^\diamond$ is
$\Theta(d 2^d)$. More generally, we show that when $\CG$ is a torus $\Z_n^d$
for $d \geq 3$, the uniform mixing time of $X^\diamond$ is $\Theta(d n^d)$
uniformly in $n$ and $d$. A critical ingredient for our proof is a
concentration estimate for the local time of random walk in a subset of
vertices.},

we show that the total variation mixing time of the random walk on the

with threshold $1/2T_{{\mathrm {cov}}}(\mathbf {Z}_n^d)$. We give a general

applies include bounded degree expander families, the intersection of an
infinite supercritical percolation cluster with an increasing family of balls,
the hypercube and the Caley graph of the symmetric group generated by
transpositions. The proof also yields precise asymptotics for the decay of

proved the existence of a finitary homomorphism with finite expected coding
length. In this paper, we construct such a homomorphism in which the coding
length has exponential tails. Our construction is source-universal, in the
sense that it does not use any information on the source distribution other
than the alphabet size and a bound on the entropy gap between the source and
target distributions. We also indicate how our methods can be extended to prove
a source-specific version of the result for Markov chains.

random walk in random environment after $n$ steps, and consider the maximum

positive constant a.s. We prove that $\liminf_n (\log\log\log n)\xi^*(n)/n$ is
a positive constant a.s.; this answers a question of P. R\'ev\'esz (1990). The
proof is based on an analysis of the {\em valleys /} in the environment,
defined as the potential wells of record depth. In particular, we show that
almost surely, at any time $n$ large enough, the random walker has spent almost
all of its lifetime in the two deepest valleys of the environment it has
encountered. We also prove a uniform exponential tail bound for the ratio of
the expected total occupation time of a valley and the expected local time at
its bottom.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  We give potential theoretic estimates for the probability that a set $A$
contains a double point of planar Brownian motion run for unit time. Unlike the
probability for $A$ to intersect the range of a Markov process, this cannot be
estimated by a capacity of the set $A$. Instead, we introduce the notion of a
capacity with respect to two gauge functions simultaneously. We also give a
polar decomposition of $A$ into a set that never intersects the set of Brownian
double points and a set for which intersection with the set of Brownian double
points is the same as intersection with the Brownian path.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Consider the radial projection onto the unit sphere of the path a
d-dimensional Brownian motion W, started at the center of the sphere and run
for unit time. Given the occupation measure mu of this projected path, what can
be said about the terminal point W(1), or about the range of the original path?
In any dimension, for each Borel set A subseteq S^{d-1}, the conditional
probability that the projection of W(1) is in A given mu(A) is just mu(A).
Nevertheless, in dimension d>=3, both the range and the terminal point of W can
be recovered with probability 1 from mu. In particular, for d>=3 the
conditional law of the projection of W(1) given mu is not mu. In dimension~2 we
conjecture that the projection of W(1) cannot be recovered almost surely from
mu, and show that the conditional law of the projection of W(1) given mu is not
mu.

ARXIV:SUMMARY = {  Consider the zero set of the random power series f(z)=sum a_n z^n with i.i.d.
complex Gaussian coefficients a_n. We show that these zeros form a
determinantal process: more precisely, their joint intensity can be written as
a minor of the Bergman kernel. We show that the number of zeros of f in a disk
of radius r about the origin has the same distribution as the sum of
independent {0,1}-valued random variables X_k, where P(X_k=1)=r^{2k}. Moreover,
the set of absolute values of the zeros of f has the same distribution as the
set {U_k^{1/2k}} where the U_k are i.i.d. random variables uniform in [0,1].
The repulsion between zeros can be studied via a dynamic version where the
coefficients perform Brownian motion; we show that this dynamics is conformally
invariant.
